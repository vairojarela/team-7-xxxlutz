# XXXLutz / Team 7

## Description

This is a result of a one-day hackathon at Ironhack. Our proposal is based on a user-centered navigation where the user would choose some filters and the website would be able to offer a personalized result based on the data inputted. 

Some of the categories are assumptions and we would encorage further studies to determine the different types of users, styles, status and living situations that could influence the customer's buying process. 


## User Stories

- **404** - As a user I want to see a nice 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault.

- **500** - As a user I want to see a nice error page when the super team screws it up so that I know that is not my fault.

- **homepage** - As a user I want to be able to find a specific product -that I'm looking for- using conventional categories for it (e.g. kitchen, outdoors, bathroom,etc) as well as having an alternative, more humane way of navigating which enables me to get real-time recommendations based on the data that I input on the website (such as living-situation, relationship status, children, style preferences, budget,etc).

- **home screen** -  As a user I want to have a general view of my playlists, my favourite artists,my favourite albums as well as the search bar. Also, I will see a fixed nav(that will be present throughout all my private screens) at the bottom of the screen with three buttons: home, search and my playlists).
